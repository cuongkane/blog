# Instantly Create Slides with LLM Tools: A Game Changer for Communication

In today’s fast-paced world, effective communication is essential for success—whether you’re pitching an idea, teaching a concept, or sharing insights.

While tools like PowerPoint have long dominated the presentation landscape, a new wave of technology is revolutionizing how we create slides: Large Language Models (LLMs) like Grok, ChatGPT, and Claude,...

These AI-powered tools can help you craft compelling slides instantly, combining their writing capabilities with human creativity.

Let’s explore how LLMs are transforming slide creation and how you can leverage them for more effective communication.

## Overview

### The Evolution of Generative AI

Generative AI has made significant progress in a relatively short time.

From early experiments in natural language processing to today’s sophisticated LLMs, these models have evolved from simple chatbots into multi-purpose tools capable of writing essays, generating code, and even producing creative content.

Developed by innovators like xAI (Grok), OpenAI (ChatGPT), and Anthropic (Claude), LLMs utilize vast datasets and advanced algorithms to understand context, generate human-like text, and solve complex tasks.

This evolution has opened up new possibilities—including the ability to streamline workflows such as slide creation.

### LLMs’ Strength: Writing Code and More

One of the standout strengths of LLMs is their ability to write code.

Whether it’s Python, HTML, or LaTeX, these models can generate functional snippets in seconds, saving you time and effort.

Their utility doesn’t end there; they excel at structuring ideas, summarizing content, and even suggesting visuals or layouts. When it comes to slides, LLMs can produce both the content and the code to format it, making them a comprehensive solution for presentation needs.

### Why Slides Matter: Accelerating Conversations

A well-crafted slide deck can transform a vague discussion into a focused, impactful conversation.

Slides transform complex ideas into digestible visuals, keeping your audience engaged and on track. In meetings, classrooms, or conferences, the right slides enhance understanding and decision-making. However, traditional slide creation can be time-consuming—a task that LLMs can dramatically reduce by automating the process while maintaining quality.

## Slide-as-Code Tools

To unlock the full potential of LLMs for slide creation, pair them with “slides-as-code” tools. These platforms allow you to define presentations programmatically, and LLMs can generate the necessary code for you. Here are some popular options:

- **RevealJS**: A powerful HTML-based framework for interactive, web-ready slides. LLMs can generate the HTML and JavaScript to build dynamic decks.
- **LaTeX (Overleaf)**: Ideal for academic or professional slides that require precise formatting, especially if including equations or citations. LLMs can write Beamer (LaTeX’s presentation package) code for you.
- **Mar Slides (maaslalani/slides)**: A lightweight, terminal-based tool for creating minimalist slides in Markdown, perfect for developers seeking simplicity and speed.
- **Marp**: Converts Markdown into beautiful slides with minimal effort. Simply feed LLM-generated Markdown into Marp, and you’re done.

These tools, combined with LLMs, allow you to bypass the drag-and-drop grind of traditional editors and jump straight to a finished product.

## LLMs Hands-on

Let’s walk through the process of using an LLM to create slides instantly. For this example, we’ll use Grok and Marp, but the steps apply to other LLMs and tools as well.

1. **Define Your Goal**: Decide what your slides are for (e.g., a project update, a tutorial, a pitch). Be specific about your audience and the key points.
2. **Write as a document**: If you need to write down your ideas into a document first, a detailed document is recommended to feed enough data for LLM so that they can write appropriate slides based on that.
3. **Prompt the LLM**: Ask the LLM to generate slide content in Markdown (or your tool’s format). For example:
   ```
   Write a 5-slide Markdown presentation for a team meeting about project progress. Include a title slide, an overview, key milestones, challenges, and a next-steps slide.
   ```
   **Generate the Output**: The LLM will produce something like this:
   ```

5. **Plug into Your Tool**: Copy the Markdown into Marp (or your chosen platform), adjust the styling if needed, and export it as a PDF or HTML deck.
6. **Review and Present**: Skim through the slides for accuracy, add visuals as desired, and you’re ready to present!

## Tips

### Tips to work with LLM
The quality of your slides depends on your prompt. Here are some tips to get it right:
- **Be Specific as much as possible**: Please thinking your expectation carefully and include specific expectation like the number of slides, audience, tone (e.g., formal, casual),...
  - *Good*: “Create a n-slide in RevealJS for a casual meeting about our app follow: (...). Slide making principles:...”
  - *Bad*: “Make some slides.”
- **Iterate if Needed**: If the output isn’t perfect, refine your prompt. Add details like “short sentences” or “include examples.”
- **Test Small**: Start with a single slide to nail the style before scaling up.
- **Guide the Structure**: Mention slide titles or sections if you have a vision (e.g., “Slide 1: Intro, Slide 2: Problem, Slide 3: Solution”).

### Principles for making slides 
- **Guide the slides to follow your principles**: There are some suggested principles that you can consider:
    **Keep it Simple**: Use minimal text (e.g., 6-8 words per line) and avoid clutter.
    **Strong Visuals**: Incorporate high-quality images, charts, or icons over text-heavy slides.
    **Contrast & Color**: Use bold colors and contrast (e.g., dark text on light background) for readability.
    **Focus on Key Points**: Highlight one idea per slide; avoid overloading information.
    **Engage with Stories**: Use relatable examples or narratives to connect emotionally.
    **Readable Fonts**: Choose clear, large fonts (e.g., 24pt+ for body, 36pt+ for titles).
    **Consistency**: Maintain uniform design (fonts, colors, layouts) throughout.
    **Use Animation Sparingly**: Add subtle transitions or emphasis, not distractions.
    **Know Your Audience**: Tailor content and tone to their interests and needs.
    **Practice Delivery**: Pair slides with confident, dynamic speaking to hold attention.

## Warnings
- Always double-check the slides before the presentation to ensure they meet your expectations.
- Be cautious with the images used in the slides, as they may be protected by copyright; please check carefully before using them in your presentation.
- Don't put protected information on non reliable websites.

## Conclusion

Large Language Models (LLMs) like Grok, ChatGPT, and Claude are more than just conversation partners; they are powerful tools for creating slides quickly and efficiently.
By leveraging their ability to write code and combining them with slide-generating tools, you can transform ideas into polished presentations in just minutes.
This approach is beneficial for developers, educators, and business leaders alike, as it saves time, enhances clarity, and improves communication.
So, the next time you’re faced with a tight deadline or an empty slide deck, consider using an LLM to handle the workload and bring your ideas to life.
